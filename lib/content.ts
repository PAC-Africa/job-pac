By applying, I agree that PAC Africa may collect and process the information in this application, including my CV, contact details, work history, and the fields above, to evaluate me for this role and, if I create an account, to match me with similar roles in future.

I understand that my CV and application details are shared only with the employer for the specific role I apply to, and with PAC Africa staff reviewing applications. PAC Africa does not sell my data or share it with any other third party.

I understand that my data is retained for as long as my account is active. Historical applications may be kept indefinitely as part of PAC Africa's hiring records unless I request deletion. I can request a copy of my data or ask PAC Africa to delete it at any time; details are set out in the Privacy Policy.

I give this consent under the Kenya Data Protection Act, 2019, and, where applicable, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
